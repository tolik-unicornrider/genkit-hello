Analyze this meme: {{media url=imageUrl}}
{{#if text}}text: "{{text}}"{{/if}}

I need a thorough explanation for someone who doesn't understand the meme. Please include:

1. A detailed description of what's visible in the image (facial expressions, actions, composition).
2. Any relevant context:
   - If it's from a computer game, TV series, movie, cartoon, etc, name it and describe the scene or setting.
   - If it's a historical photograph or painting, please provide historical context.
3. Explain how/why this image became a meme and what makes it funny (consider irony, cultural references, common usage patterns).
4. If there is text on the image:
   - If the text is **not** in English or Russian, translate it into **both** English and Russian.
   - Show how the text interacts with the visual elements to enhance or create the meme's humor.

Don't use markdown, html or xml tags in your response. Use only plain text.
